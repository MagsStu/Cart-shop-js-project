Shop cart Javascript Project

This project consisted of creating a page for an online shop with a basic cart functions avaiable (changing quantities by adding, removing or updating the number of items in said cart).

Some additional functionalities include a working slider at the bottom of the page, a search bar that filters products based on the title and hides element that do not match the input as well as a "View more" option which opens up a small modal displaying some extra information like the author, longer description, price and a made up number of products left in the stock.
